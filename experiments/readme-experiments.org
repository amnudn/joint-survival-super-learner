#+Title: Numerical experiments with the state learner

The experiment is run on a server using the Slurm Workload Manager, which is
setup in the files [[zel-sim2-1.R]] and [[submit_zel-sim2-1.sh]]. When the experiment is
run, results are collected by running the command =targets::tar_make()= in =R=
from this directory. The figures from the article are made in
[[../figures/sl-make-figures.org]].

To construct a single draw from the experiment, instead of all the 1000 draws
used in the article, the function [[../R-code/functions/numerical-study-sampler.R]]
can be used. To do so, first run the command:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code
library(here)
library(targets)
tar_source(here("R-code/functions"))
#+END_SRC
