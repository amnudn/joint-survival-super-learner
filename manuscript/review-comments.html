Comments to the Author
</p>

<p>
This paper proposes a super learner-style estimator of conditional
cumulative hazard functions in the context of right-censored
time-to-event data with competing risks. The user specifies libraries
of candidate estimators of the conditional cumulative hazards of the
event, censoring, and competing risk times. The proposed method then
selects the element of the product of these libraries that has the
smallest cross-validated empirical risk, where the risk is based on a
carefully constructed loss function. A key benefit of the proposed
methods over alternatives is that it jointly estimates the three
cumulative hazards, rather than iterating between estimation of them
or requiring a pre-specified censoring survival estimator. The authors
provided an oracle inequality demonstrating that the true risk of the
estimator is no worse than a constant multiple of the oracle risk up
to a logarithmic penalty in the size of the library. The authors also
provide numerical studies and a simulation illustrating the good
performance of the proposed method.
</p>

<p>
Overall, this is a nice contribution to the literature, and I am
grateful to the authors for the methods an accompanying theory. The
paper is well written and careful, though I think more effort could be
made in parts to make the notation somewhat more accessible. In
particular, an outline of the proposed algorithm in its totality would
be useful for readers.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="on"><code>[X]</code> Answer: Thank you for this comment, we agree that it is a good
idea with an outline of the proposed algorithm. We have added a
pseudo-algorithm to the paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have two main comments. My first comment regards a sentence in the
discussion: ``A potential drawback of our approach is that we are
evaluating the loss of the learners on the level of the observed data
distribution, while the target of the analysis is either the
event-time distribution, or the censoring distribution, or both.” I
didn’t quite catch this on a first read-through of the paper, but I
think it is an important point that deserves to be emphasized more
throughout the paper. Specifically, this makes me wonder about the
relevance of the oracle inequalities in Proposition 2 and Corollary 3:
do we actually care about these risks? I usually care about
inequalities and rates of convergence of the conditional survival (or
cumulative hazard) function of the event time, censoring time, and
competing risk. If I understand the above comment correctly, the risk
considered in the paper doesn’t directly give such inequalities and
rates. Is that correct? If so, it deserves to be mentioned and at
least briefly discussed in the section on theoretical results.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="on"><code>[X]</code> <p>
Answer: This is an important point, which we agree should be
made clear in the paper. We have added the following paragraph
discussing this point at the end of Section 5.
</p>

<p>
We have also added the following reflection to the discussion:
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
Similarly, this makes me question the relevance of the IPA metric
considered in the numerical study. How do the different algorithms
compare in terms of pointwise or integrated error for the conditional
survival or cumulative hazard functions?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> <p>
Answer: In the numerical studies, we in fact do use the IPA for
the survival function of interest. We have now made this clear by
adding the following:
</p>

<p>
[As we simulate the data, we have access to &#x2026;]
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Second, and more minor, I wonder if the authors could expand on why it
is difficult to extend the method to an ensemble estimator in this
setting.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> <p>
Answer: Thank you for this comment. We do not believe that it
needs to be particularly difficult, but there are at least two
strategies that could be pursued, and we think that some additional
thought on this is needed. We have expanded on this in the
discussion with the following:
</p>

<p>
[Generalizing our proposal to ensemble learning is &#x2026; At least two
strategies could be pursued. First, ensemble for F. More
interestingly, jointly build ensembles for all element of the tuple.]

Section 3:
</p>

<p>
P5. The point that the partial log-likelihood does not work well as an
evaluation criterion is interesting and warrants further
elaboration. An additional sentence explaining this point would be
helpful. Additionally, I wonder if this problem can be circumvented in
other ways: perhaps models that normally yield piecewise constant
hazards could be included in a slightly modified form with smoothed
hazards. What would be the consequences of this approach?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> Answer: We agree that this is an important point, and we have
elaborated further with the following:</li>
</ul>

<p>
Section 4:
</p>

<p>
P5. I find the notation using "1" for the indicator function difficult
to read, especially when preceded by other numerals. Why not use I, δ,
or a bold or blackboard/double-struck 1?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> Answer: This is a good point, we have changed the notation to&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
P6. The manuscript explains that it is in principle fairly easy to use
the survival package to estimate libraries of models for A₁, A₂, and
B. The practical value of the article would improve with a web
appendix showing code implementing this for the prostate cancer study
data.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> <p>
Answer:
</p>

<p>
Notes: Emphasize that we do provide code. Perhaps make an example
where we "manually" implement and article using tools from the
survival package.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Section 5:
</p>

<p>
P8. You state that a sensible objective function must be proper. While
I don't disagree, this point often generates discussion. One might
argue that in certain problems, our objective need not be the correct
recovery of the probability distribution. Rather, we may want to
predict outcomes at specific time points while incorporating relative
costs of incorrect predictions. It's not clear that using
probabilities as an intermediate step is always optimal, especially
when these are estimated with error. Furthermore, while a proper loss
function might be optimal with large sample sizes, this may not hold
for finite samples. More discussion of this point would be valuable.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> <p>
Answer: &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Notes: We now discuss utility / cost benefit. unclear what is meant
by finite sample problem of proper loss but penalized likelihood is
a good example.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
P8. The authors quickly move from using proper scoring rules to the
Brier score, which feels less general. Are the results expected to
hold for other proper scoring rules?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> <p>
Answer:
</p>

<p>
Notes: yes, what other proper scoring rules are there? is there an
integrated deviance (log - score) maybe in Putter's book?
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
P9. At the top of the page, it's argued that the oracle inequality
provides insights into how the number of folds, time horizon, and
number of learners influence performance. Could the practical utility
of this be illustrated in the context of the prostate cancer example?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> <p>
Answer: &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Notes: no, but we have now added a comment about this.. Unclear how
to address this, because I do not believe there is any actual
practical utility to be gained from the types of inequalities. Hmm,
maybe we could say something about that in this case, our analyses
indicates that fairly complex models are used. If this is true, our
finite sample inequality shows that, for large enough samples, the
error rate will be dominated by that flexible models and not by the
cross-validation estimation step &#x2013; refer to that we seem to be in
case (b) of Corollary 3.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
P10. The performance will be specified using the IPA, which needs more
discussion. Please briefly state how it is defined and why it was
chosen. (Is the IPA itself proper? If not, does this still make sense
here? Do we need other metrics as well?)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> <p>
Answer:
</p>

<p>
Notes: IPA is simply R2 (refer to text) it is easy to see that it is proper:

Notes: Do this in the simulation setup?

</ul>

<p>
P10. For the 'second aim,' it's suggested that an advantage of the
joint survival learner may be that it is a discrete super
learner. This warrants more explanation—why is this an advantage? Is
there more risk of overfitting in small samples?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> <p>
Answer: This is an interesting point. To our knowledge, the
finite sample performance of a discrete versus continuous (ensemble)
super learner is not well understood. In the special case where the
data-generating model is included as a learner in the library, we
think that a discrete super learner could have an advantage, because
it is forced to pick one model from the library, and will with good
change pick the correct one, while an ensemble learner will always
be a mixture of the correct model and a mis-specified one. We have
expanded on this and tried to clarify that this only a possible
explanation and not a strict fact.
</p>

<p>
Notes: because we have the dgm as one of the learners.

Section 8:
</p>

<p>
P12. The stated drawback—that the authors evaluate the loss of
learners at the level of the observed data distribution while the
target is either the event-time distribution, censoring distribution,
or both—needs more detailed explanation. Are there alternatives to
this approach, and what would be their drawbacks?

points made in the introduction.

</ul>

<p>
P12. The authors claim that targeted learning is also known as
debiased machine learning.  However, these are often presented as
distinct approaches. This should be clarified.
